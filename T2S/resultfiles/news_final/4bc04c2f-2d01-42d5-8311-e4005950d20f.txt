Even as BJP struggles to combat derisive nomenclature given by political rivals in the poll-bound Bihar, party's Gaya MP Hari Manjhi has come out with another damaging name for the organization: 'Baura Jayewala Party', or a party prone to craziness. Others have called it Bharat Jalao Party, Bharatiya Jumla Party and Barka Jhuttha Party.

Prior to the arrival of Union HRD minister Smriti Irani to lay the stone Central University of South Bihar on the Magadh University campus on Monday afternoon, Manjhi and RLSP MLC Sanjeev Shyam Singh were engaged in a friendly repartee. In half jest, Singh said the BJP has marginalized the alliance partners and made it a BJP, not NDA, campaign. Manjhi, to the embarrassment of other party men, including Gurua MLA Surendra Sinha, replied, "Ee Baura Jayewala Party hai."

The MP further said if BJP could show the door to an old ally like Shiv Sena in Maharashtra during the last assembly election, the less said about other partners the better. Unlike RLSP, Shiv Sena belonged to the same 'Parivar' (family), said the BJP MP in half Magahi and half Hindi.

The MP, who earlier hit the headlines for practicing quackery even after being elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009 parliamentary election, entertained those sitting in the front row at the Directorate of Distance Education Auditorium.
