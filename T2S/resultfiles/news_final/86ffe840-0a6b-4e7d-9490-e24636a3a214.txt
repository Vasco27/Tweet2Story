Adelaide coach Scott Camporeale doesn't feel cheated, but says he wouldn't deploy North Melbourne's controversial tactic of resting players. 
 
The Roos are resting nine star players from Friday night's AFL final round fixture against Richmond - a result the Crows are sweating on for their finals campaign. 
 
If the Kangaroos win, Adelaide could host a home elimination final. 
 
But the mass resting has North expected to lose, costing the Crows a home play-off - and ensuring the Roos play in Melbourne in the first week of finals. 
 
"The rules are in place and we will just deal with it as it is," Camporeale told reporters on Friday as his team prepared to travel to Geelong for Saturday's match against the Cats. 
 
"We have just got to worry about ourselves. 
 
"I'm not going to comment on other clubs as to what they do. But for us at the moment we have picked our best 22 to win this weekend. 
 
"The rules are in place. They (North) are doing what is best for their footy club so that's fair enough, that is their prerogative. 
 
"I can only worry about what we're doing." 
 
Camporeale said he placed a higher priority on synergy within his team than resting players. 
 
"That is my philosophy at the moment, absolutely," he said. 
 
"With where our list is at in terms of a young list and the maturity of it, we need to make sure that we're all on the same page going into the first week of the finals. 
 
"There's a lot of guys who haven't been in that situation so I think that is critical going into next week."
