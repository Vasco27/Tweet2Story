The disease of addiction is a beast, and the beast wants to be fed. The ever powerful and driving force of addiction threatens the addicts livelihood. Addiction will bring you down and it does not care whose life it takes with it. When addicted, you are no longer thriving, but are barely surviving, gripping to compulsive behaviors to balance out stressors and avoid the rest of the world. Addiction is like a great escaping act: in the way that addicts isolate themselves, escaping from participating with others, and escaping from life as a whole, thus diving into a deep dark hole with no conceivable way out. Many addicts go unaware that they have a problem, and some know they have a problem but have become so beaten down by their addiction that they do not possess the strength to pull themselves out of the hole. In being buried in addiction, addicts often feel trapped. The sickness of addiction persists when an addict trades one addiction for another. This substituting comes from constantly seeking something to fill a void. Instead of forever filling that internal hole with substances or outside sources, an addict could replace those self-seeking behaviors with a recovery plan. Therapy, treatment centers, and 12-step groups could facilitate an inner peace. If you identify with any of these emotions or behaviors, you are an addict; but the good news is that there is help. In embracing the title of addict you are admitting that you have a disease, and therefore, can peruse help. In knowing what you are, you know what you must do, and there is great freedom in that.

Coordination-induced conformational change in the ligand has been monitored by circular dichroism which has been further attested by synthesizing D-leucine containing enantiomer H4LD-leu and its Cu(II) complex [Cu1.5(H2LD-leu)H2O]n.10H2O (2).

Further, structural dissimilarity in these MOF\u2019s have been judicially supported by proton conductance studies. MOF 1 shows higher proton (10-5 S cm-1) conductance in comparison to 2 (10-6 S cm-1) due to dissimilar alignment of the hydrogen bonded water molecules in hydrophilic pocket as well as crystal packing",

A recent report from analysts at HSBC bank saw ample reason for the UK Government to delay or cancel the project\u201d. In a recent debate in Parliament, Lord Howell, the pro-nuclear former Energy Secretary in Mrs Thatcher\u2019s first government, said Hinkley Point must be one of the worst deals ever for British households and British industry\u201d. He added: I would shed no tears if it were abandoned in favour of smaller and possibly cheaper nuclear plants a bit later on.\u201d   This is good advice: the Government should take the opportunity of EDF\u2019s dithering to rethink the country\u2019s nuclear power strategy. Its commitment to conventional, large-scale reactor development was just about defensible for as long as there was a realistic prospect of it actually happening on time and at reasonable cost. But yet another delay at Hinkley Point, together with all the other uncertainties surrounding the project, changes everything. We risk being saddled with a white elephant while leaving our nuclear future at the tender mercies of the political agendas operating in other countries\nThe last Labour government shamefully neglected the one source of power that would help create self-sufficiency and meet low carbon objectives: nuclear energy. Only when it was too late and much of the industry\u2019s expertise had been lost did Labour ministers realise their folly and try to reactivate the programme. The Coalition, despite Lib Dem objections (which mattered, since they ran the Energy Department) kept it alive and agreed to build the first new reactor for 30 years at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But serious questions are now being asked about the wisdom of this deal\n ",

There\u2019s a hostile element within the community at large. There\u2019s in many incidences a lack of support on the part of elected officials and police management. And there\u2019s this ubiquitous social-media effort to discredit all police officers because of the extraordinarily rare misconduct by a very few.\u201d   Add it all up, and many police officers feel under attack \u2014 especially after Darren Goforth, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Harris County, was gunned down while pumping gas last Friday\n You\u2019re lucky. You\u2019re going to die soon,\u201d the driver, Kevin Daigle, allegedly told Vincent before shooting him with a sawed-off shotgun. Later, police found Daigle\u2019s roommate dead. Louisiana State Police spokesman Sgt. James Anderson said police are investigating whether Daigle was involved in that killing\n Nonetheless, many officers and ordinary citizens think that police face new dangers \u2014 and much less public support \u2014 since black teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., a year ago",

Big gains have come from Emirates Cup Day and Crown Stakes day\nPunter ticket sales soar too  Ticket sales have also soared, after a couple of quieter carnivals. With that comes the big fashion spend. In each of the last two carnivals, spending has been stagnant, with $31.4 million of attributed Victorian sales on fashion items specifically to wear to Flemington. That figure includes an estimated 5000 hats and fascinators, 61,000 dresses, 59,000 pairs of shoes and 30,000 handbags. Men are spending big, too, with 17,000 shirts and 15,000 suits sold for the carnival last year. The data shows the sales dont all go to big marketers, such as Myer, but also benefit smaller boutiques, milliners and shops. Indeed, while Myer battles through tough times at the tills, high-end Melbourne tailor Oscar Hunt has done so well a Sydney store was opened last week. Who said bricks and mortar retail was dead  Southern-most charter among 50 countries  The overseas raid on the carnival now expands beyond the actual racetrack. On Saturday, 10 European-trained horses arrived in Melbourne and went into quarantine. But the VRC is expecting visitors in Melbourne from almost 50 different countries, up from 43 last year. That number does come with a warning. It includes the first ever international passenger flight out of New Zealands southernmost city, Invercargill, and a place that is the butt of many a joke across the ditch. Apparently the only other overseas destination you can get to from Invercargill Airport is Antarctica, as long as you are happy to stay for six months on a scientific expedition. The planeload of 180 Kiwi racing fans is actually a little braver - they have chartered the flight to the Melbourne Cup as a day trip\nSales are up across the board, with corporate hospitality up more than 12 per cent up on this time last year",
