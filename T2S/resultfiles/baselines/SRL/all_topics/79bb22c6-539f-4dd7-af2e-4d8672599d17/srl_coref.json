    "coref_content": "LONDON : after his typically cuss victory in the US Open final on Sunday night, his climb up to celebrate with those in his's player box, who happen to include a celebrity buddy in the shape of the scottish actor Gerard Butler. when his look at a celebrity buddy in the shape of the scottish actor Gerard Butler, his say, this be Sparta! his say. it feel great. that s one of the most inspiring movie his watch. the quote come from a celebrity buddy in the shape of the scottish actor Gerard Butler signature role in 300, a Hollywood retooling of the story of 300 brave Spartans resist a giant persian army at the battle of Thermopylae. it make sense that the concept should appeal to his, because go to war against a numerically superior force be what his do most week. when his defeat Roger Federer on Sunday, the extreme one - sidedness of the crowd - who repeatedly applaud his's fault and yell out during his's service action - can rarely have be match on such a major occasion. and yet his seem to suck up the hostility and turn the hostility into energy. as Roger Federer push hard late in the second set, his win a point with an unlikely backhand counter - punch and then perform a violent -twiste leap of celebration that feel like an up yours to the crowd - who repeatedly applaud his fault and yell out during his service action. one lesson from his typically cuss victory in the US Open final on Sunday night be that few player in history have possess great psychological resilience. which have not always be a give for his. as recently as last year, his's run of five defeat in six grand - slam final have prompt muttering, his's steadiness under fire. yet with the help of his's late coach, Boris Becker, a fellow contrarian, his delivery at clutch moment have go from be a suspect area to a source of pride. another moral of Sundays story be that if the fan really want the other bloke to win, the fan should not spend the match wind his up. like sledge a great batsman, this be counter - productive, because defiance be D - jokovics middle name. his's entire life story have be about take -unpromising situation and -twiste -unpromising situation into motivation. his entire life story start with his's upbringing in war - tear Serbia, where facility be so scarce that some of his's contemporary be reduce to practise in empty swimming pool. then come the inexplicable -physical collapse that his eventually learn be connect to a gluten allergy. and, finally, his face the challenge of the Roger Federer - Nadal axis, perhaps the great double - act in tennis history. on the court, his have overthrow the swiss - spanish duopoly so successfully that his be about to finish the season as world no1 for the fourth time in five year. his's only remain problem could be describe as affection deficit disorder - the fact that his remain mostly immune to his's charm. yet who would bet against his to win the fan round in the end here be a man who will not be balk in a man who will not be balk in his design, who believe that no goal be beyond he's design, who believe that no goal be beyond a man who will not be balk in his design, who believe that no goal be beyond he. Roger Federer come into this final having win Roger Federer's last 28 set, many of his last 28 set with contemptuous ease. but Roger Federer know that, even at Roger Federer's good, Roger Federer have to play the perfect match to beat his. Roger Federer do not perform -poorly. in all, Roger Federer win 145 point to his 147. but it be noticeable that, whenever Roger Federer carve out break point, Roger Federer lack a clear idea of what to do next. you could almost see the thought bubble above Roger Federer head. should Roger Federer go to the net no, Roger Federer m not get any short ball and only hell pass Roger Federer if Roger Federer come in from back here. well just have to rally, not that Roger Federer s likely to miss ... the key statistic be the 19 break point that his save, as oppose to just four that Roger Federer manage to convert. the quality of Sundays showdown must be alarming for the rest of the peloton. Roger Federer and his have only extend Federer and Djokovic's lead on everyone else in the ranking table. Djokovics third major of the year carry Djokovics third major of the year to 10 title overall. after another commanding season, Nadals 14 must seem tantalisingly close at hand for Djokovics third major of the year ..",
