    "coref_content": "it appear that a train could arrive on the platform, several metre above ground level. five year be a considerable amount of time to obtain planning permission. clarify a certain usage can be problematic. and when there be three train support on a rooftop, thing can get even more difficult. the design be conceive more like a bridge than a traditional building, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects, say. but have a variety of occupant throughout the design certainly stretch thing out, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects say. previously a 480 - square - metre vacant lot in Easey Street, Collingwood, Easey Street, Collingwood have be use by parking truck for many year. rather than a 480 - square - metre vacant lot in Easey Street, Collingwood, the Commercial 2 - zone plot remain vacant, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects have act as both architect and co - developer. we want to build on the street culture in the immediate area, a pocket of Collingwood that s a centre for graffiti artist not just in Melbourne, but in Australia, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects say. follow on from architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects Hive apartment in Carlton, a concrete brutalist pile, the Easey Street, Collingwood development comprise office, hospitality business and cafe. occupy two street frontage, occupant and visitor can approach from the main street or from the lane behind. extend over five level, its not only the brutalist concrete facade that resonate, but the three train that appear to hover precariously on the rooftop. we be nt try to capture the idea of trainspotting. it be about engage with the graffiti culture, often associate with disused train, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects say. to locate disused train may take time for an architect, but ask a graffiti artist and there s an instant lead. we be direct to a man who have a collection of disused train which he purchase from the railway, say architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects, who have to use considerable ingenuity not only to crane up the three train that appear to hover precariously on the rooftop, but also anchor the three train that appear to hover precariously on the rooftop on the rooftop. the weight of each train require a different structural approach, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects say, point out the steel track below each train that have be cement into the roof foundation. while the rooftop highlight the graffiti culture associate with train, so do the ground floor cafe and building facade. the cafe, know as Zone one, share the train / graffiti culture. base on the zone - one yellow paper ticket, use prior to Myki, the cafe, know as Zone one feature graffiti - spray wall and seating that once would have grace the disuse Hitachi M - class train. even the bar at Zone one take the form of concrete track. Most of these train run from the 1970 through to the 1990, say architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architectsthe cafe, know as Zone onethe rooftop. other cue from the disuse Hitachi M - class train appear on the facade of the Easey Street development. the platform in the train station, for example, have be flip over to reveal the signage and tactile indicator ( advise traveller to stand behind the line ). and door to entrance have be customise use train track and sleeper. while the exterior be relatively free from graffiti, the interior be heavily cover with graffiti wall, as be the disuse Hitachi M - class train. the graffiti have be curate, architect Zvi Belling​, a director of ITN Architects say, point out the three layer of graffiti on one of the cafe wall. unlike the many passage, the office, vary in size from 40 square metre to 65 square metre, remain pristine white. some of the office have be design with balcony and galley - style kitchen, while other appear more robust, like the one at ground level that may be more conducive to a hospitality use or even for off - street car parking. while the outlook from the office be impressive, offer panoramic view of Melbourne skyline and environ, it the aspect from the train, one of which be currently use as a cafe, that draw the applause. complete with outdoor courtyard ( wedge between two train ), one could almost believe the disuse Hitachi M - class train be about to arrive on the platform, several metre above ground level. the story first appear on the Sydney Morning Herald ..",
