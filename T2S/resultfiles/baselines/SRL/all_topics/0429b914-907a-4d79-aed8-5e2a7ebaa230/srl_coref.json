    "coref_content": "LONDON : England complete England's preparation with a 21 - 13 victory over Ireland on Saturday, put England in great heart for England's World Cup opener against Fiji back at Twickenham in 13 day but leave Ireland to deal with a second successive defeat. England score two early try through winger Jonny May and Anthony Watson to lead 12 - 3 at the break and though Ireland briefly get close with a Paul OConnell try early in the second half, England deservedly close the game out with two Owen Farrell penalty. when England play at home, England can be pretty good when England stick to England's system, say England captain Chris Robshaw, who again top the tackle count with 18. England put Ireland under pressure today and it be a great dress rehearsal before the big one in two week time. England be unrecognisable from the disorganised side well beat by France two week ago, on the front foot from the start and ahead within three minute when May, normally note for May, normally note for his searing pace's searing pace, this time use power to blast through Tommy Bowe. England's lineout, so ragged in Paris, be back to England ’s lineout, so ragged in Paris's productive good and a successfully complete one lead to George Ford deliver a pin - point kick into the corner where Anthony Watson soar above Simon Zebo to catch and score. May, normally note for his searing pace think May, normally note for his searing pace have score May, normally note for his searing pace's second when May, normally note for his searing pace finish off a fizzing move only for the TMO to rule his second out for a forward pass. Ireland struggle to get any sort of foothold in the game, with only an early Jonathan Sexton penalty to Ireland's name as Ireland turn round somewhat fortunate to be only 12 - 3 down. Ireland show more intensity after the restart as Paul OConnell lead by example, burrow over for Ireland's first try, which, after a penalty apiece early, make it 15 - 13. England become a bit ragged, lose a scrum against the head, knock on, miss overlap and generally getting bogge down as both side empty both side's bench. England's great white hope Sam Burgess get 20 minute and a second cap but England ’s great white hope Sam Burgess be unable to make much of an impact other than one bone - shudder tackle in the final exchange. after the TMO rule out another England try Ireland finally get the scoreboard move again with a penalty by Farrell, who land another three minute from the end to settle it. England be now on a run of seven win at Twickenham since go down to South Africa in November 2014 but Ireland have work to do after home and away defeat. Ireland start poorly, Ireland keep drop the ball, and you can not accumulate those sort of loss and expect to do well, say Paul OConnell. alarm bell be not ring but Ireland be very disappointed. Ireland have fall short of a lot of thing Ireland want to do. ( edit by : Toby Davis ).",
