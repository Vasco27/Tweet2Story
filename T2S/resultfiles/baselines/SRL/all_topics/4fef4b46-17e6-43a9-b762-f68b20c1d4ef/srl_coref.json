Brazil economic downturn, Brazil's bad in 25 year, could nudge the countrys central bank in the opposite direction though. economist have be forecast policymaker will start to cut rate next year, take its benchmark interest rate to 12.00 percent at end-2016, accord to a weekly the countrys central bank survey. in the the countrys central bank view, Brazil ongoing adjustment could take long and be more intense than anticipate. gross domestic product be expect to shrink 2.4 percent in 2015, accord to economist in the the countrys central bank weekly poll. the countrys central bank will probably stay in waiting mode, watch the volatility in local market and the discussion on fiscal policy, say Carlos Kawall, chief economist at J.Safra in Sao Paulo. if the countrys central bank do nt see improvement on the volatility in local market and the discussion on fiscal policy and the exchange rate remain too weak for a long time, there be the risk interest rate will be increase again.
