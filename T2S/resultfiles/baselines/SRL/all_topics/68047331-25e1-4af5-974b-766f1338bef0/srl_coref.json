Rosberg ’s be go to have a good go at Sebastian Vettel ’s because finally Rosberg ’s have the brake cool off to be able to attack. just when Rosberg ’s ’ve need to catch up in point, it ’s be the big loss that Rosberg ’s ’ve have in one day in the whole season, so the big loss that I ’ve have in one day in the whole season ’ very bad, \" Rosberg ’s add. but Rosberg ’s keep go ; give up do n’t exist for Rosberg ’s, just keep fight and now Rosberg ’s ’ll just try and win the next couple of race. \" the final podium position be resolve in Felipe Massa's favour by a scant 0.4sec after Felipe Massa's Williams team - mate Valtteri Bottas put Felipe Massa under intense pressure. they have run third and fourth early on until Rosberg ’s undercut they in the pit stop, but as Felipe Massa's tyre wear out his Williams team - mate Valtteri Bottas close in. Felipe Massa ’m too old for this, \" Felipe Massa joke, after three final lap of high - speed pressure. Felipe Massa might have be order not to talk openly about they's gripe over manufacturer Pirelli's tyre, but Sebastian Vettel ’s be blisteringly outspoken at the prospect of Monza be drop from the F1 calendar as chief executive Bernie Ecclestone and the race organiser continue to argue over the cost of contract renewal for 2017. if we take Monza away from the F1 calendar for s****y money reason, you be basically rip our heart out, \" Sebastian Vettel ’s say. the emotion here be incredible. you stand on the grid and look to the left and to the right, and people be just so happy to be part of it. \".",
