Lord Howell, the pro - nuclear former Energy Secretary in Mrs Thatcher ’s first government add : Lord Howell, the pro - nuclear former Energy Secretary in Mrs Thatcher ’s first government would shed no tear if Hinkley Point in Somerset be abandon in favour of small and possibly cheap nuclear plant a bit later on. \" this be good advice : the Coalition should take the opportunity of the indebted state - own french energy company EDF's dithering to rethink the UK's nuclear power strategy. the UK's commitment to conventional, large - scale reactor development be just about defensible for as long as there be a realistic prospect of conventional, large - scale reactor development actually happen on time and at reasonable cost. but yet another delay at Hinkley Point in Somerset, together with all the other uncertainty surround agree, change everything. we risk be saddle with a white elephant while leave the UK's nuclear future at the tender mercy of the political agenda operate in other country. what be require be a new era of nuclear power generation, focus on small, cheap reactor design and build here in the UK to provide local energy generation. in the long run, we should be invest in thorium reactor, which have none of the risk and waste associate with the uranium fission cycle. we need to rediscover the drive and vision that bring North Sea oil ashore 40 year ago ..",
