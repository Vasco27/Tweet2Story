    "topics.content":"During an interview on KykNets Insig , Motsoeneng criticised journalists for inaccurate reporting as he explained why he is lobbying for the country to regulate the media as a whole. Journalists dont do what they are supposed to do. When they report they are not factual on their reporting. They always take sources that are not even credible and dont do their own research to give the people of South Africa the facts. When asked about the balance between good news and bad news being reported by the SABC, Motsoeneng said, Maybe we need to understand the role of media. The role of media is to influence the mindset of people, young and old. Lets take example [sic] - the young ones. If you always put crime on media, you report about crime... actually what you are doing you are encouraging young people to commit crime. The interview began trending on social media, with users weighing in on different sides on the argument.",
