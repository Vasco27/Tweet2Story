    "topics.content":"NEW YORK (CNNMoney) \u2013 Before Trevor Noah takes over one of the most recognizable shows in TV from one of TV\u2019s most beloved hosts, he\u2019s getting in some practice.   The 31-year-old South African comedian has held several tests shows in September with his last taking place on Thursday night.   While the test show will never air, it allowed Noah and his Daily Show\u201d staff to get ready before Monday\u2019s big debut.   To kick off the show, Noah didn\u2019t scribble on his script like Jon Stewart, choosing instead to calmly introduced himself as if it was his actual first broadcast.   This is surreal for me,\u201d Noah began. Growing up in the dusty streets of South Africa, I never dreamed that I would one day have two things: an indoor toilet and a job as the host of the \u2018Daily Show.\u2019 Now, I have both.\u201d   Noah addressed how strange it must be for viewers to not see Jon Stewart behind the desk.   It kind of feels like the family has a new step-dad\u2026 and he\u2019s black,\u201d Noah said to a big laugh.   Noah acknowledged Stewart for believing in him and promised to continue Stewart\u2019s war on bulls***.\u201d   Noah\u2019s first segment touched on Pope Francis\u2019 U.S. trip and included long-time correspondent Jordan Klepper, who tried unsuccessfully to turn attention to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, who is also in the U.S.   The rebooted Daily Show\u201d also introduced two new correspondents in Ronny Chieng and Roy Wood Jr.   Wood\u2019s energy grabbed the audience as he pretended to be outside Madison Square Garden waiting for Pope Francis with gifts that were actually clutter he cleaned out of his apartment.   Noah welcomed CNN host Fareed Zakaria as his guest for the show\u2019s final segment, calling him one of the smartest people he knows.   The two spoke at length about Washington politics and the Iran nuclear deal along with mentioning that Zakaria was one of Stewart\u2019s most frequent guests.   Following the interview, Noah closed the show the same way Stewart had for years with a simple moment of zen\u201d before bidding the audience a goodnight.   The hundreds in Thursday\u2019s audience were treated to a brand new host along with a brand new set.   The set had a sleek look with a dark blue color tone, and while completely different from the one that Jon Stewart hosted from for years it did have the same feel.   On Monday Noah has the almost impossible task of replacing Stewart not only as an entertaining host, but as a news commenter for millions of people.   Noah and the show\u2019s content in many ways had the comedic edge and brains of Stewart\u2019s long-time telecast. However, it may take viewers some time to warm up to someone who is just not Jon Stewart.   For Andrew Hartnett, who was in the audience on Thursday, Noah seemingly pulled it off giving an unexpectedly steady performance.   He seemed very confident, which was the thing I wasn\u2019t expecting,\u201d Hartnett said. He seemed to kind of fill the role.\u201d   Rachel Bergnam, 22, who had been to a Stewart taping, said that the energy felt very much like the Daily Show\u201d of old.   He can\u2019t replace Jon,\u201d she added. But it was a really positive experience.\u201d.  ",
