From the experience of several major housing providers across the country, we could see that Greentree was fast becoming an industry standard system.\u201d      Brett Hanna is the CEO of Regional Housing Limited (RHL), the largest community housing organisation in regional Queensland. It administers over 400 properties, mainly for low-income people, and also operates a shelter and support programmes for homeless youths.      RHL is growing steadily, through various mergers and alliances with other social housing organisations. Its latest innovation is developing housing especially for the disabled. Managing such growth requires a comprehensive, flexible business system.      RHL is a stalwart user of Greentree.      A vital safety net   Since 1992 RHL has been a core housing service, first in the Bundaberg community and now throughout central Queensland. On average it resolves housing problems for 30-40 families a month, in a region affected by poverty and high unemployment. Demand for its services can be directly affected by national economic conditions, so RHL has to be responsive, especially as a provider of emergency relief.      Our entire organisation is outcome focused,\u201d says Brett. We\u2019re the safety net for people in the community who are facing homelessness because of financial distress or other circumstances.\u201d      Financial control, tenancy management and various wraparound special services are complex things to handle. RHL needed a system that could integrate all those functions and make life easier.      RHL had been dependent on half a dozen disparate business systems, which were unable to communicate with each other. Manual spreadsheets and various scattered databases made for hard labour in calculating maintenance costs and rental incomes. RHL also has to generate monthly reports for its board, along with quarterly and annual reports for various government agencies involved in housing and welfare.       Greentree has reduced the time spent in producing reports by around 40%, having eliminated all that manual labour.\u201d    Brett Hanna, CEO Regional Housing Limited       There wasn\u2019t any depth in the demographic data and we couldn\u2019t really report the depth of what we provide in services or records,\u201d explains RHL\u2019s Business Development Officer, Kris Robinson. Government reporting is a huge task \u2013 probably about 25% of our workload involves capturing accurate data and being able to report it efficiently in the right format for whichever agency requires it.\u201d      Some of those reports would take days or even weeks to complete,\u201d adds Brett.      Greentree outshines competitors   Government agencies increasingly require data uploads, rather than dealing with paper-based reports, so RHL went looking for a system that could automate data processing. The shopping was aided by a regional taskforce of similar providers, which shared information about business systems. Backed by endorsements from the likes of Compass Housing Ltd, Greentree became RHL\u2019s choice over Technology One and Kypera.      Greentree was superior on several points,\u201d Brett says. Other systems we looked at had asset and property management at their core, but were really challenged to do CRM and financial management. Other deciding factors were the strength of Greentree\u2019s Partner network, the fact that we could integrate so many functions into the one system, and the price.\u201d      Today, RHL\u2019s reporting problems have largely disappeared. Breaking up data into various programmes for consolidated reports used to take three to four days \u2013 now it takes half a day.      Having all our data in one centralised system, and knowing that we can trust that data, has reduced the time spent in producing reports by around 40%, having eliminated all that manual labour,\u201d says Brett. Greentree also enables us to monitor staff performance, giving us a level of quality control that we never had before.      Greentree\u2019s Approvals & Alerts has let us build delegations and controls into the system, largely removing the risk of human error in approving actions. Having that control has been life-changing.\u201d      A very nimble organisation\u201d   Greentree\u2019s Workflow desktops have delivered peace of mind to RHL\u2019s staff and auditors, who know that the live data in front of them is controlled and secure \u2013 especially important when it comes to tasks like arrears management. Kris can extract data from the system in minutes, to fill any request, and Brett has the convenience of accessing Greentree from mobile devices wherever he is, to make authorisations.      RHL is excited about moving into disability housing, where it has some new ideas to help make disabled tenants even more independent.      I think we\u2019ll also see growth in our support services,\u201d says Brett. We\u2019re a very nimble organisation, so if there\u2019s a new opportunity emerging you can be sure we\u2019ll be on the front foot with it and generally one of the first.      Greentree has increased our capacity and efficiency as an organisation, streamlined processes, and strengthened our ability to become the high-performing organisation that we\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u201d      Source: This article was originally sourced from Greentree International             FURTHER READING September 10, 2015 | Greentree International  Regional Housing Limited\u2019s ERP software choice adds to a growing list in the social housing sector...
