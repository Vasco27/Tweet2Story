His remains will be brought to St Michaels Garrison Church in\u00a0Collins Barracks\u00a0at 3.45pm today, for a prayer service\u00a0in advance of tomorrows funeral.      Kent was one of the 16 men executed in the aftermath of the Rising and one of only two executed outside Dublin, the other being Roger Casement, who was hanged in London.      Kent was a prominent organiser of the Irish Volunteers and was arrested following an incident at his Castlelyons\u00a0home, in which a Royal Irish Constabulary officer was killed and Thomas brother Richard was fatally injured.      Taoiseach Enda Kenny offered a State funeral to the Kent\u00a0family earlier this year and the family accepted.      Kents remains were exhumed in Cork Prison in June.\u00a0            His remains will leave Collins Barracks at 12pm tomorrow with full military accompaniment to Cork Prison for the formal removal service.      There will be a short private service inside, to which there will be no public access.\u00a0      The Cortege will then\u00a0depart for St\u00a0Nicholas\u2019s Church, Castlelyons at 12.45pm.   Kent will be re-interred with his brothers\u00a0in St Nicholas Church\u00a0during tomorrows funeral.\u00a0         The requiem mass will be attended by President Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Enda Kenny and\u00a0T\u00e1naiste Joan Burton.      Mr Kenny will deliver the Graveside Oration..  ",
