    "topics.content":"Here, we report a self assembled homochiral metal organic framework [Cu1.5(H2LL-leu)(Ac)H2O]n.2H2O (1) obtained from L-leucine derived ligand (H4LL-leu) and Cu(Ac)2\u2219H2O in 1:1 ratio. Coordination-induced conformational change in the ligand has been monitored by circular dichroism which has been further attested by synthesizing D-leucine containing enantiomer H4LD-leu and its Cu(II) complex [Cu1.5(H2LD-leu)H2O]n.10H2O (2). Structure determination revealed entirely different structures for homochiral MOF (1 and 2) obtained from L-\/ D-leucine derived enantiomer ligands under analogous reaction conditions. Further, structural dissimilarity in these MOF\u2019s have been judicially supported by proton conductance studies. MOF 1 shows higher proton (10-5 S cm-1) conductance in comparison to 2 (10-6 S cm-1) due to dissimilar alignment of the hydrogen bonded water molecules in hydrophilic pocket as well as crystal packing..
