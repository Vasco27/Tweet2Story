    "topics.content":"FOX LAKE, Ill. \u2014 The humid night air vibrated with the sound of cicadas and helicopters as police scoured the woods in this village near the Wisconsin border, searching for three men suspected of gunning down a police lieutenant.   I hope they find them and blow their heads off,\u201d said Jeff Peterson, 57, a construction worker doing his wash at a laundromat not far from the crime scene. It\u2019s time for [officers] to fight back.\u201d   The death of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a father of four and an Army veteran known as G.I. Joe,\u201d on Tuesday marked the fourth fatal shooting of a law enforcement officer in the country in the past two weeks. Although the overall number of on-duty deaths is down from last year, the rash of killings is fueling a new debate over the risks of being a police officer in the post-Ferguson era of anti-police demonstrations.   It\u2019s a trifecta\u201d that officers are facing, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police. There\u2019s a hostile element within the community at large. There\u2019s in many incidences a lack of support on the part of elected officials and police management. And there\u2019s this ubiquitous social-media effort to discredit all police officers because of the extraordinarily rare misconduct by a very few.\u201d   Add it all up, and many police officers feel under attack \u2014 especially after Darren Goforth, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Harris County, was gunned down while pumping gas last Friday.   \u2018No one is safe\u2019   Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman has called it a cold-blooded execution\u201d driven by the dangerous national rhetoric that is out there today.\u201d The rant against police, he said, has gotten out of control.\u201d   This week, Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the spate of killings at a news conference in Washington. In addition to Gliniewicz and Goforth, two officers were killed last week in Louisiana.   I strongly condemn these recent and brutal police shootings,\u201d Lynch said Wednesday, tying the shootings to other recent bursts of violence that have captured national attention, including the deaths of TV journalists in Virginia, military members in Tennessee, moviegoers in Louisiana and church parishioners in South Carolina.   It is a sad fact now that no one is safe,\u201d Lynch said, adding, This wide violence against all of us \u2014 regardless of what uniform any of us wear \u2014 has to end.\u201d   This year, 26 police officers have been killed by firearms, including two in training accidents, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. That is the second-lowest number in the past five years, the group says, noting that the number of officers killed has declined steadily after peaking in 1975.   Nonetheless, many officers and ordinary citizens think that police face new dangers \u2014 and much less public support \u2014 since black teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., a year ago.   #BlueLivesMatter   Brown\u2019s death spawned a national campaign against police brutality dubbed Black Lives Matter. Activists say the recent violence against officers bears no relation to their movement.   Nobody is held accountable for the people killed who don\u2019t have a badge,\u201d said Jason Ware, 20, an activist with We Charge Genocide in Chicago, where protesters marched last week to demand a civilian police-accountability council.   We want more community investment, more schools, more neighborhood parks, more mental health facilities. These are all things that reduce violence,\u201d Ware said. To blame violence on people who are calling for things that actually reduce violence doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d   Nonetheless, a pro-police movement has sprung up using the Twitter hashtag #BlueLivesMatter .   Tell me again it isn\u2019t open season on cops #BlueLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter,\u201d tweeted author and Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich hours after Gliniewicz was found, stripped of his gun and pepper spray, in a marshy area of Fox Lake early Tuesday.   There is no indication that race or anti-police sentiment played a role in the killing. Gliniewicz, 52, was a 30-year veteran who was due to retire at the end of September. He radioed dispatchers shortly before 8 a.m. Tuesday, saying he was chasing three suspicious subjects on foot. Contact with Gliniewicz was soon lost, police said. Another officer later found his body.   Dozens of heavily armed officers quickly joined helicopters and search dogs in a manhunt for the suspects, who were described as three men \u2014 two white and one black. Police said they have not made any arrests, and the manhunt is continuing.   Residents describe Fox Lake, a village of about 10,000 people 60 miles north of Chicago, as a close-knit town where police officers are well-liked and racial tension is rare. Doors are often left unlocked, even as summer visitors flock to the area\u2019s lakeside cabins.   It\u2019s like Mayberry,\u201d said Jim Tybor, a factory supervisor who knew Gliniewicz and described him as the most cheerful guy who was always smiling.\u201d   Line of duty   Most of the officers killed this year have died in similar situations. Unlike Goforth or New York City police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, who were gunned down in Brooklyn in December by a man who boasted on social media that he planned to kill police, most officers have died in the routine performance of their duties.   For instance, in Carson City, Nev., Deputy Sheriff Carl Howell was responding to a domestic-battery call when he was killed Aug. 15. After checking on a woman who was injured, Howell went to get the other side of the story from the other person\u201d in the home, said Sheriff Ken Furlong. It resulted in a spontaneous gunfight.\u201d   Furlong and other police officials said the Black Lives Matter movement has not sparked attacks on police but is shining a spotlight on the quotidian risks officers long have faced. Several pointed to past tragedies, including four officers who were ambushed by an ex-convict in a coffee shop in suburban Tacoma, Wash., in 2009 and two others who were ambushed while eating pizza in Las Vegas in 2013.   Your vocation, it results in you becoming a target even in your off time,\u201d said Furlong, who said the biggest factor contributing to police killings is the ease with which mentally ill people can obtain firearms.   Sworn to protect   In Hayward, Calif., homicide Sgt. Ryan Cantrell has a similar viewpoint. On July 22, Hayward police Officer Scott Lunger was fatally shot during an early-morning traffic stop. But the killing, Cantrell said, had nothing to do with anti-police sentiment.   Although nearby Oakland is a hotbed of protest,\u201d Cantrell said, I\u2019ve got to tell you that here it\u2019s the total opposite. We have so much community support.\u201d   Louisiana State Trooper Steven Vincent died Aug. 24 while checking on a car stalled in a ditch.   You\u2019re lucky. You\u2019re going to die soon,\u201d the driver, Kevin Daigle, allegedly told Vincent before shooting him with a sawed-off shotgun. Later, police found Daigle\u2019s roommate dead. Louisiana State Police spokesman Sgt. James Anderson said police are investigating whether Daigle was involved in that killing.   Anderson thinks the threat to police is on the rise.   There are people out there who don\u2019t particularly care for the police these days,\u201d he said. We took this job to protect and serve the community that we\u2019re sworn to protect. It\u2019s tough feeling like you have a target on you when you\u2019re doing that.\u201d   Kari Lydersen,   The Washington Post.  ",
