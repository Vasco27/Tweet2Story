Starting at William the Conquerors Tower of London   Lighting is an art as well as a science, and its been really exciting and a lot of fun for us to participate in this event, alongside the SLL and CIBSE, continued Mr. Campagna. We hope it will inspire the next generation of lighting designers, and remind others of the huge role lighting plays in their daily lives.  Combining their love of light and art, design teams will showcase the practical applications of lighting and how it can improve and enhance architecture. The event will spotlight UNESCO World Heritage Sites to bring additional recognition to these internationally acclaimed locations. About The Society of Light & Lighting (SLL)  The SLL is considered the premier setter of professional practice and authority on lighting design matters. The organization publishes guidance and codes, which are internationally recognized as authoritative, and sets the criteria for best practice in the profession.
