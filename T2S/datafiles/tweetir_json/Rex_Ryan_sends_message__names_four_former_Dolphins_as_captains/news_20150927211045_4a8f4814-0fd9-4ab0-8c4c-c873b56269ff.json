(Photo by Brett Carlsen\/)      For the Buffalo Bills Week 3 game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, Ryan made a statement -- sort of. He named four former Dolphins as captains before the game in an attempt to show Miami who theyre missing.      Those four players were Charles Clay, Richie Incognito, Marcus Thigpen, and Dan Carpenter.      Ryans extra form of motivation seemed to have worked. On the Bills first drive of the game, Clay caught three passes for 58 yards and a touchdown. Needless to say, Clay sent a statement to his former team right away.
