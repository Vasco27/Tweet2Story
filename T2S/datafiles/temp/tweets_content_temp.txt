Police lining the station platform now. Protecting a train without migrants on. Looks like a domestic train on opposite platform.  
Reminder: No trains operating on SRT due to scheduled track work. Replacement buses operating..  
Train service has resumed operations. Trains #423 and #424 are first trains to and from the Airport..  
 The only information that I have is that theyre working on it and the trains should be running by the end of the year. *mh.  
 We had a police request to stop trains. Trains are now back on the move..  
High priority to get on track   #Cranbourne #Melbourne #trains
